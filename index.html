  <p>Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Get tough with it, get strong. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll do another happy little painting. Take your time. Speed will come later. Just a little indication.

All those little son of a guns. There comes a nice little fluffer. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky.</p>

<p> Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud.</p>
