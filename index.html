	<!-- foldername/ = go inside folder
	filename = use a file in the current directory
	../ = leave the current folder and go up to parent folder (directory) i.e. ../images/intro-pic.jpeg would leave exceptional-realty folder and go up to find that image
	be careful about case sensitivities, and whether it's jpg or jpeg
	src stands for "source" and points to the image, and alt is for alternative, for ppl who are visually impaired, and using screen readers. also important for search engines, who are looking for alt text
	a stands for anchor link , also think of a for action, which links to other html page
	index.html always needs to be there, and will be first
	target="_blank" makes that link open up to new page

	Validating My HTML Code:
	if i have a malformed p tag, it's okay, i can always check my code to check it. cmd+C
